GeometricShapes Folder
=======

This folder contains classes to represent geometric shapes, namely circles and rectangles. Each class has methods for calculating the area of the respective shape.

1. Shape (Abstract Base Class)

This is the abstract base class for all geometric shapes. It defines an abstract method calculate() that should be implemented by the subclasses.

2. Circle

The Circle class represents a circle shape. It inherits from the Shape class and implements the calculate() method to compute the area of the circle.

3. Rectangle

The Rectangle class represents a rectangle shape. Similar to the Circle class, it inherits from the Shape class and implements the calculate() method to calculate the area of the rectangle.


PolymorphicAnimalSounds Folder
===========

This folder contains classes representing different types of animals. These classes demonstrate polymorphism by overriding a method for making sounds.

1. Animal (Base Class)

The Animal class serves as the base class for all animal classes. It contains properties and methods common to all animals.

2. Cat, Dog, Duck (Subclasses)

These subclasses (Cat, Dog, and Duck) inherit from the Animal class. They override the makeSound() method to provide specific animal sounds.

GeometricShapes Folder - Code
========

The provided code demonstrates a basic implementation of classes to represent geometric shapes and calculate their areas.

Shape is an abstract class with an abstract method calculate().
Circle and Rectangle are concrete subclasses of Shape that calculate the area based on their properties.

PolymorphicAnimalSounds Folder - Code
==============

The provided code illustrates polymorphism using animal classes:

Animal is a base class with common properties and methods for all animals.
Subclasses like Cat, Dog, and Duck override the makeSound() method to provide animal-specific sounds.
Remember to integrate these code snippets into your actual codebase and customize them according to your application's requirements.
